## Ship Detection from Satellite Images
A huggingface competition to detect ships from satellite images

Tow different algorithms was used in this competion:
- YOLO-V8
- Pytorch FastRCNN

Installation:
``` 
git clone 
pip install -r requrements.txt
```


TO-DO:
- Dffuculties in traning the Pytorch model on colab even after reducing the model and datasets to FP16. Looking to train on cloud service
